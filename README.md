# Marangoni_flow_in_Evaporative_Droplet
Combination of surface tension driven flow and evaporation driven flow in droplet based on Stokes flow assumption.

Run ```Combination.m``` to superpose the dimensionless stream function due to evaporation to the dimensionless stream function due to surface tension in a droplet based on a certain ratio that depends on the humidity of the ambient and surface tension difference of the droplet.
